        <p>Hello! My name is Gaweth Thalon, and I am from Port-au-Prince, Haiti. I enjoy reading, learning new skills,
            and serving
            in my church. I am currently studying Web & Computer Programming through BYU-Pathway Worldwide. I am excited
            to improve
            my programming skills, build useful projects, and gain more experience in the tech field. I look forward to
            applying
            what I learn to future opportunities and seeing how this path will shape my career.</p>
